#Ramp up fire sequence planning
1.5s ignitor window
3s ignitor burning to fuel hitting chamber
150ms Lox lead

#300 psi initial tank target pressure
Run with these tank pressures for 0.5 seconds to allow chamber pressure to build up

#Begin ramp up sequence, modified bang bang with the target increasing over time
Ramp up to 500 psi tank pressure over the course of 5 seconds
#This is consistent with a 1400 psi reg pressure set, and about how much we have been filling the tanks with prop

Hold for 0.5 seconds

Begin closing main valves, keep fuel flowing into chamber for 100ms longer than lox
purge at 400 psi, 250ms after commanding FMV to close
